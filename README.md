# The Manchester Plastic Mouse Phantom
Welcome! The files in this repository can be used to 3D print the lungs, skeleton and body surface of a mouse. The data for these structures were extracted from a CT scan of a mouse.

Plastic mouse can be used for any purpose you wish. We developed it in order to help in the quality assurance of pre-clinical irradiation plaforms.
